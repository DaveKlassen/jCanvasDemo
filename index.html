				<h2>JCanvas Examples</h2>
				<canvas class="intro" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
				<p>
					I chose to use the JCanvas plugin for JQuery for this assignment,
					which can be downloaded from 
					<a href="http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/downloads/">Caleb Evans'</a> 
					personal site. According to the author he has been developing websites 
					<a href="http://calebevans.me/about/">since 2010</a>. JCanvas is
					a way for us to make use of the Canvas via. JQuery. As most of the
					examples show JCanvas has been used for quite a few 
					<a href="http://calebevans.me/projects/">2D projects</a>, but I 
					could not find any 3D examples to learn from (At least not along the 
					lines of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread">Banana Bread</a>).
				</p>
				<p>
					For working with the plugin I chose to review the examples provided 
					by the Mozilla 
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">Canvas Tutorial</a>
					and gain an understanding for what I could do with the JCanvas 
					interface, mostly because after reading the documentation website
					I didn't see anything that excited me, and I did want to learn
					much more about what I could do with Javascript and a HTML5 Canvas Object.

				<h2>Regular Javascript</h2>

					What follows is from the first few pages of the Canvas Tutorial:

				<canvas id="tutorial3" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="tutorial4" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="tutorial5" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="tutorial6" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="tutorial7" width="150" height="200"></canvas>

				<h2>JCanvas API</h2>
				<p>
					Here are the same objects created using the JCanvas API:
				</p>
				<canvas id="jcanvas2" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="jcanvas3" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="jcanvas4" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="jcanvas5" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="jcanvas6" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
				<canvas id="jcanvas7" width="150" height="200"></canvas>
				<p>
					In comparison I do not quite see what the benefits are of
					using JCanvas rather than the APIs provided by browsers.
					While JCanvas is fairly simple to use I expect the base
					APIs are more powerful, and I hope to learn more about 
					this in the future.
